    <h2 class="section-title">What Are We About?</h2>
    <ul class="list-with-icons">
        <li><strong>Community First</strong>: We’re building a nest for those who want to come together in good spirits and memes. Whether you’re a meme lord, a peace advocate, or just someone who likes a good internet joke, Peace Pigeons is your home.</li>
        <li><strong>Memes for Peace</strong>: We believe in the power of memes to connect people. Memes are the universal language that transcends borders, and we’re using that to unite the flock.</li>
        <li><strong>Surprise Perks</strong>: While we’re focused on having fun, we do have a few surprises in store. Think meme superconferences, meditation retreats, and more—all just for being part of the flock. No promises, no strings attached, just rewards for our loyal pigeons.</li>
